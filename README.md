# Mealie AutoChef

Weekly meal-planning → shopping-list → grocery-cart automation for a
self-hosted Mealie instance. Bailey approves the weekly plan over Telegram,
then taps one button in Food Lion To Go to place the order. Everything
in between is automated.

Target store: Food Lion, pickup only.

## Documentation

- [Setup Walkthrough](docs/SETUP_WALKTHROUGH.md) — concrete 10-step first-run guide (start here)
- [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) — weekly operation, Telegram commands, configuration reference, troubleshooting
- [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) — architecture, schema, data flow, how to extend

For running project context and locked decisions, see `MEMORY.md`.
**Read it before making changes** — several decisions (pickup-only, manual
checkout, Playwright over AI browsing, Ruby+ActiveRecord with one isolated
Python file) are intentional and documented.

## What it does

```
Thursday ~6 pm — AutoChef picks this week's dinners
  → Claude Haiku arranges them into a perishability-aware schedule
  → sends a Telegram message: plan + inline Approve/Swap/Regenerate buttons
  → "⚙ Configure week" button links to the web form at :3456/week

You (optionally, before approving)
  → open the week configurator form
  → set protein excludes, per-day overrides, servings, vibes, freeform note
  → tap Regenerate in Telegram to apply

You (before the weekend) — tap Approve

AutoChef (on Approve)
  → scales servings, injects recurring staples, resolves product map
  → consolidates duplicate search terms (quantities summed)
  → pushes "Next Order" list to Mealie
  → opens Food Lion To Go in a headed Chrome browser
  → clears any items from a previous run
  → adds every item, selects a pickup slot, STOPS before checkout
  → sends "Cart ready: $XX.XX — tap here to review and place"

You — tap the link → review the cart → place the order
```

The cart builder never places an order. That is always you.

---

## Language: Ruby, with one Python file

Everything is Ruby (plain Ruby + ActiveRecord/ActiveModel, no Rails) except
`cart_builder/cart.py`, which stays Python because Playwright's official
best-supported bindings are Python/Node/Java/.NET. See the docstring at the
top of `cart_builder/cart.py` for the full reasoning and the IPC contract.
Ruby shells out to it as a subprocess and parses JSON from stdout.

### Why no Rails app

ActiveRecord and ActiveModel work standalone. This project is a CLI batch
job — no controllers, views, or asset pipeline. A full Rails app would add
Zeitwerk autoloading and multi-environment conventions this project doesn't
need, for ~7 models. Revisit only if a real web UI appears.

---

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.2+ (`ruby --version`)
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
- Python 3.11+ with pip (cart_builder only)
- SQLite3
- Docker + Docker Compose (for production Unraid deployment)
- A running self-hosted Mealie instance
- A Telegram bot (for plan approval and notifications)

---

## Quick start

For a full walkthrough with expected output at each step, see
[docs/SETUP_WALKTHROUGH.md](docs/SETUP_WALKTHROUGH.md). The short version:

```bash
# 1. Install Ruby deps
bundle install

# 2. Configure secrets
cp .env.example .env
# → fill in MEALIE_API_TOKEN, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID

# 3. Fill in config.yaml (three FILL IN values: store.name, pickup_window_pref, spending_cap_usd)

# 4. Verify everything wires together
bundle exec ruby main.rb check

# 5. Python side (cart_builder only)
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r cart_builder/requirements.txt
playwright install chrome
python3 cart_builder/cart.py --login   # interactive browser session setup
deactivate
export CART_BUILDER_PYTHON="$(pwd)/.venv/bin/python3"
```

---

## CLI commands

All commands follow the pattern `bundle exec ruby main.rb <command>`.

| Command | Phase | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `check` | 0/1 | Validate config, run migrations, ping Mealie and Uptime Kuma |
| `sync` | 1 | Pull `avg_rating` and `lastMade` from Mealie into `recipe_stats` |
| `plan [note]` | 2+3 | Score recipes, build week plan, send Telegram draft for approval |
| `serve` | 3+6 | Long-running Telegram bot + Sinatra week configurator (port 3456) + rufus-scheduler |
| `shop` | 4 | Scale ingredients, inject staples, push "Next Order" list to Mealie |
| `build-cart [--force]` | 5 | Fetch Next Order list → drive Food Lion cart via Playwright |
| `feedback [--force]` | 6 | Increment times_cooked, update tag_weights from kept plan |
| `budget` | 6 | Print monthly/YTD spend from order_history |
| `backup` | 6 | Copy `data/autochef.db` to `data/backups/`, trigger Mealie backup |

---

## Setup

### 1. Network (Docker)

AutoChef expects Mealie at `http://mealie:9000` on a shared Docker network
called `mealie_net`:

```bash
docker network create mealie_net
docker network connect mealie_net <your_mealie_container_name>
```

If your Mealie container has a different hostname, update `mealie.url` in
`config.yaml`. For local development outside Docker, set `MEALIE_URL` in
`.env`:

```
MEALIE_URL=http://localhost:9000
```

### 2. Secrets

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `MEALIE_API_TOKEN` | Mealie UI → your username → API Tokens → create one |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | console.anthropic.com |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram → `@BotFather` → `/newbot` |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Telegram → `@userinfobot` (your personal chat ID with the bot) |
| `FOODLION_USERNAME` | Your Food Lion / Instacart account email |
| `FOODLION_PASSWORD` | Your Food Lion / Instacart account password |
| `UPTIME_KUMA_PUSH_URL` | Uptime Kuma → Monitors → Push-type monitor → Push URL |
| `MEALIE_URL` | Local dev override only (e.g. `http://localhost:9000`) |

`FOODLION_USERNAME` / `FOODLION_PASSWORD` are used once to seed the
browser session (`python3 cart_builder/cart.py --login`). After that, only
the saved `data/playwright_state.json` is used.

### 3. Config

Open `config.yaml` and fill in the three `FILL IN` values:

```yaml
store:
  name: "Food Lion - City, State"   # your preferred pickup location
schedule:
  pickup_window_pref: "Sun 10:00-12:00"
safety:
  spending_cap_usd: 150
```

### 4. Install Ruby dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

`Gemfile.lock` is committed. This should be deterministic.

### 5. Verify setup

```bash
bundle exec ruby main.rb check
```

Expect `PARTIAL` if running outside Docker (Mealie unreachable). Config + DB
OK is enough to proceed with recipe setup.

### 6. Tag recipes in Mealie

```bash
bundle exec ruby scripts/tag_recipes.rb
```

Interactive script — walks every Mealie recipe and prompts for the tags
AutoChef uses: `auto-plan`, `cuisine:*`, `protein:*`, `effort:*`,
`makes-leftovers`. Also sets `shelf_life_days` on each food for
perishability-aware scheduling.

### 7. Sync to local DB

```bash
bundle exec ruby main.rb sync
```

Pulls `avg_rating` and `lastMade` from Mealie into `recipe_stats`. Re-run
any time ratings or cook history change.

### 8. Python side (cart_builder)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r cart_builder/requirements.txt
playwright install chrome

# One-time interactive login to Food Lion — saves session to data/playwright_state.json
python3 cart_builder/cart.py --login

deactivate
export CART_BUILDER_PYTHON="$(pwd)/.venv/bin/python3"
```

### 9. Seed the product map

```bash
bundle exec ruby scripts/seed_product_map.rb
```

Interactive — fetches every autochef-managed item from the Mealie "Next Order"
list and walks you through mapping each one to a Food Lion search term, pack
size, and default quantity. Run this after the first `main.rb shop`.

**First run:** expect ~50 items (all ingredients from your initial recipe pool).
**Steady state:** only new ingredients from newly-added recipes need mapping —
most weeks require no seeding at all. `main.rb shop` reports unmapped items
by name at the end of its output.

Flags: `--list` (show existing mappings), `--update` (re-map already-mapped items).

---

## Run via Docker (production)

```bash
docker network create mealie_net   # if not already created
cd docker
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

The Dockerfile builds both Ruby and Python runtimes. `CART_BUILDER_PYTHON`
is set via `ENV` in the Dockerfile so `cart_client.rb` finds the right
Python interpreter automatically inside the container.

## Safety features

All are on by default. The system is designed to require human action
at every meaningful step.

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Dry-run mode** (`safety.dry_run: true`) | Cart built but never auto-placed. Keep this on. |
| **Spending cap** (`safety.spending_cap_usd`) | Cart total > cap → abort + Telegram alert |
| **Kill switch** | `touch data/PAUSE` halts all ordering; `rm data/PAUSE` resumes |
| **Idempotency** | Each weekly run has a unique key; re-running reconciles, not double-builds |
| **Deviation alert** | Built cart total deviates >20% from estimate → Telegram warning |
| **Out-of-stock policy** | Never silently substitutes — flagged items need human review |

---

## Running tests

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

44 examples, 0 failures. Tests use in-memory SQLite (`:memory:`) and
transaction rollback isolation — they never touch `data/autochef.db`.

---

## Cart builder behavior

- **Headed Chrome** — `headless=False` is required; Food Lion's bot-detection blocks headless browsers.
- **Cart cleared on every run** — `build-cart` empties the existing Food Lion cart before adding items, so `--force` re-runs are safe and never create duplicates.
- **Quantity consolidation** — if multiple recipes need the same Food Lion search term (e.g. "salmon fillet" for two recipes), their quantities are summed into one cart entry before cart.py is called.
- **Pantry items** — ingredients marked `s` in `seed_product_map.rb` are excluded from the cart and listed to stdout + Telegram so you can verify stock before pickup.
- **`/add` items** are in the Mealie "Next Order" list and are always re-added by the normal build flow — they survive a cart clear.

---

## Unraid deployment notes

See `MEALIE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` section 12 for Docker Compose configuration
and Unraid User Scripts setup. The key points:

- Mount `data/` as a persistent volume on your array
- Mount `.env` as a read-only secret or use Unraid's Docker secrets
- `data/playwright_state.json` must be pre-seeded on the host (it's in `.gitignore`)
- `main.rb serve` runs the bot continuously; the weekly `plan` command can be
  fired by Unraid User Scripts on a Thursday schedule or left to rufus-scheduler
  inside the `serve` process
