## Flows Not Yet Triggered in Any Session

These are implemented code paths that have never executed on the live system:

1. **`main.rb feedback`** — requires a completed pickup week with a matching `order_history` row
2. **`main.rb budget`** — requires at least one completed `order_history` row
3. **Thaw reminders and morning pings** — rufus-scheduler fires at specific times; never observed
4. **Crash alert** — `Notifier.send_crash_alert` never triggered by a real exception
5. **Kill switch** — `data/PAUSE` file never created
6. **Regenerate with freeform note** — the multi-step bot prompt for typing a note before regenerating
7. **`/shop` Telegram command** — cart rebuild from Telegram without touching the CLI
8. **Session expiry re-login** — `playwright_state.json` will expire eventually; re-login tested once on 2026-06-28

## Upcoming — Needs Verification Once Built

These will need end-to-end testing after each feature lands:

| Feature | When to test |
|---|---|
| Auto-map (`main.rb automap`, Feature 6) | ✅ Verified 2026-06-28 (12th session) |
| Previous Purchases optimization | Run `main.rb build-cart --force`, check stderr for "Previous Purchases pass", verify `available` count > 0 and items added correctly. If `available=0`, update selectors in `cart.py` using playwright codegen on `foodlion.com/shop/my_items`. |
| LLM Cart Review (Feature 7) | After implementation — verify correction flow on a live cart |
| LLM Aided Shopping (Feature 8) | After implementation — verify per-item screenshot + LLM selection |
| Recipe Sleep (Feature 9) | After implementation — verify sleep/wake/reset bot buttons |
| `/newrecipes` (Feature 10) | After implementation — verify import → Mealie → auto-map chain |
| "⚙ Configure week" link | After Docker deployment on Unraid |
| Uptime Kuma push | After Bailey creates Push monitor and sets `UPTIME_KUMA_PUSH_URL` |
| `main.rb feedback` | After first real pickup week completes post-Unraid deploy |
